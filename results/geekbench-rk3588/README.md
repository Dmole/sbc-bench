## Geekbench RK3588 data mining

Quick download of RK3588(S) Geekbench results (`links dump https://browser.geekbench.com/v5/cpu/...`) to do some data mining as can be seen in the `parse-geekbench-results.sh` script.

While this seems like a lot of different devices most probably it's just a few in reality with some guy sitting in a lab, tweaking settings and running one Geekbench after another.

An adjusted list trying to remove the obvious duplicates (same GB version number, similar timestamp and multiple listings) is [results-redacted.md](results-redacted.md). Such a list might help with estimating [PVTM](https://github.com/ThomasKaiser/Knowledge/blob/master/articles/Quick_Preview_of_ROCK_5B.md#pvtm) effects.
